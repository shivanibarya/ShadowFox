Java Development Internship Projects

Welcome to my repository showcasing my projects from my Java Development Internship at ShadowFox. Each project demonstrates different concepts and skills I acquired during my internship. Below are the details of each project.

Task Level (Beginner):-
1)Enhanced Console-based Calculator:
Develop a console-based calculator that includes basic arithmetic
operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) along
with additional functionalities such as scientific calculations (e.g.,
square root, exponentiation) and unit conversions (e.g.,
temperature, currency).
Key Learning: Basic Java syntax, methods, error handling, and
additional mathematical operations.

2)Simple Contact Management System:
Create a simple command-line contact management system using
Java. Allow users to add, view, update, and delete contacts. Store
contact information like name, phone number, and email address in
memory (no database required).
Key Learning: Basic CRUD operations, user input/output, array or
ArrayList data structures.

Task Level (Intermediate):
2)Inventory Management System with Basic GUI:
Develop an Inventory Management System with a basic Graphical
User Interface (GUI) using JavaFX or Swing. Implement
functionalities like adding, updating, and deleting inventory items.
Key Learning: GUI design, event handling, basic CRUD operations
in a graphical environment.

3)Library Management System with Data Persistence (SQLite):
Enhance the Library Management System with features like user
accounts, book recommendations, and integration with an external
book information API (optional). Use SQLite for data persistence
instead of a full-fledged database.
Key Learning: Data persistence with SQLite, API integration
(optional), user management.

Task Level (Advanced):
2)Real-time Chat Application with Java Socket Programming:
Build a real-time chat application using Java Socket Programming.
Allow multiple users to join chat rooms, send messages, and receive
instant updates.
